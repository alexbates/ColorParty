# Color Party

**Color Party** is a fast-paced multiplayer Minecraft minigame (Spigot plugin) inspired by Hypixel's *Pixel Party* and HiveMC's *Block Party*. Players must quickly move to the correct color tile before the floor disappears beneath them. The game consists of 25 rounds that become progressively shorter and more intense.

At the start of each round, a terracotta block is placed in each player's inventory, indicating the safe color. Players have up to 5 seconds to relocate to that color. After the timer ends, all other tiles vanish‚Äîeliminating anyone standing on the wrong block.

## Features

- **Villager NPC spawn point** at `59.5, 66, -392.5` in the Overworld. Right-clicking the NPC teleports players to *ColorPartyWorld*.
- In *ColorPartyWorld*, any player can start the game by right-clicking:
  - **Emerald** for Normal Mode  
  - **Amethyst Shard** for Crazy Mode
- Game continues until all players fall except one.
- After the game ends, players must click the Exit bed and rejoin via the NPC to reset the map.
